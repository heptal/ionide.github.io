### MsBuild 2015 - Windows only

On **Windows** MsBuild 2015 needs to be installed. You can download it [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48159)

### .Net Core - Optional

We also recomend installing .Net Core, even if you plan to target Full .Net Framework. Several features such as debugging, and project scaffolding are using features available only for new, SDK-based project files.
